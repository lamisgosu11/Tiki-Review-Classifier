# Ecommerce website (Tiki) Review sentiment classifier

This is my school project for my Machine Learning class at the University of Information Technology (DS103).

## Getting Started

Sentiment classifier Examine the comments that show on Tiki's Ecommerce website. The dataset was manually scraped from the Tiki website based on a variety of product categories. </br>
In this assignment, I will try a variety of approaches. I will then compare those techniques and select the best one to use.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the repository.
```
* Python
* Imported libraries.
* Streamlit. (In the future, we intend to construct a web UI using streamlit for the Interface)
* The dataset was manually crawled and added to the repository.
```
### Installation

A step-by-step guide will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ Download the dataset from the repository
$ Set up Python and Jupiter notebook.
$ Install the libraries that I imported in requirements.txt.
```

## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks.

```
$ Import the dataset and library in the folder in the order of the repository.
$ Execute the .ipynb files (modify the dataset folder as necessary)
$ Examine the results.
$ We will extend these features later for future implementation (input new comments and auto sentiment identify them).
$ Run streamlit files for web UI. (will be update later)
```

## Deployment

Further information on deploying this on a live or release system is available (web UI). Discusses the most important branches, the pipelines they activate, and how to keep the database up to date (if anything special). <br />
By far, the classifier performs admirably on the product, which is books (maybe because Tiki is an ecommerce site that sold most books).
